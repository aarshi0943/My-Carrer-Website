                <span id="show1" class="hide">
                    <h3>Python</h3>
Python is always recommended if you’re looking for an easy and even fun programming language to learn first. Rather than having to jump into strict syntax rules, Python reads like English and is simple to understand for someone who’s new to programming. This allows you to obtain a basic knowledge of coding practices without having to obsess over smaller details that are often important in other languages.

Python also is ideal for web development, graphic user interfaces (GUIs), and software development. In fact, it was used to build Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify, so it’s clearly in demand among employers in addition to having a faster onboarding.
<h3>C</h3>
While C is one of the more difficult languages to learn, it’s still an excellent first language pick up because almost all programming languages are implemented in it. This means that once you learn C, it’ll be simple to learn more languages like C++ and C#.

Because C is more “machine-level”, learning it is great for teaching you how a computer functions.

Companies too are keen to hire third-year engineering student as compared to first-year and second-year students as a third-year student has more knowledge of technology and is more corporate ready.
<br>

<ol><li> You can browse through the official website of the companies you are interested in interning with and look for available internship openings. If there is an opening, you can directly apply through the company’s website.</li>
<li>
    You can reach out to your college training and placement cell and apply to companies for the internship through them.
</li>
<li>
    If any of your friends or family members are working in a good position and can provide you with a referral, ask for it. Referrals make getting an internship easy as your profile is not lost in the heap of other resumes sent online
</li>
<li>
     Internship portals give you access to all the latest internship openings. You can register with internship portals. make your profile, upload your resume and search for internships meant for engineering students of your branch.

                <b>&emsp;How To Become a Full Stack Developer ?</b>&emsp;&emsp;<button class="clicktoshow3 read">Click to Read </button></center>
                <span id="show3" class="hide">A full stack web developer is a programmer with competency in both front-end and back-end technologies.Front-end is the part which is seen and used by the user. The back-end involves the processes, databases and other processes like user validation, that are required to run and process the instructions from the user.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Programming : </b>To handle the back-end process, one must have a good grasp of programming languages.Python as a programming language is dominating in the field of technology.</li>
                        <li><b>Mastering Backend and Frontend : </b>needs an expert in each of the areas of both the ends, also she/he must have a keen knowledge of the tools and technologies which are involved in the process.</li>
                        <li><b>Understanding of Frameworks and Tools : </b>For the front-end technology part, one can learn ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JS, BootStrap, etc. while for the back-end technology part, one can learn NodeJS, Python, Ruby, etc.</li>
                        <li><b>Understand Databases : </b>Data is the fuel in an organisation and being a full-stack developer must know where this fuel is being stored and how to access it when needed. Having good knowledge of storing and accessing data from databases and understand of SQL, NoSQL, etc. is a value-added step in order to become a full-stack developer.</li>
                        <li><b>Develop Any Web Application from Scratch : </b>
                        The best way to learn something is by building something.Thus it is also very important to build and develop something from scratch parallelly while learning. Learn the tools and frameworks and imply them in the project. This way, it will enhance the process of learning whenever he/she gets stuck or faces problems in the project.</li>
